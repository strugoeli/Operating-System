In this assignment you are required to deliver a functional static library, that creates and manages userlevel threads.
A potential user will be able to include your library and use it according to the packageâ€™s public interface:
the uthreads.h header file.
Your task is to implement all the detailed functions, as explained in exercise description. You will probably find it necessary
to implement internal functions and data structures. These should not be visible outside the library, as they
are the private part of your implementation. You are not restricted in their number, signatures, or content.
You are required to write clear, readable and efficient code. 

FILES:
Makefile -- the Makefile
uthreads.cpp -- the implementation of the user-level threads library
Thread.h -- header file of class representing the instances of threads
Thread.cpp -- the implementation of the thread class
ThreadManager.h -- Singleton, manage all the operation between threads
ThreadManager.cpp -- Implementation of the ThreadManager class
